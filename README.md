## Frontend Kit - React

This subproject is a web application example for topic server. We already implement basic functions for fetch data from backend server and all the layout things such as frame design or react router rules, it's ready to be a quick start example.

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), Beside the **Typescript** template can be triggered from create command options, we also import **Redux** and **Redux-Saga** for state management. Please check [here](https://www.vhudyma-blog.eu/add-redux-saga-with-typescript-to-your-react-application-january-2021/#Step-2.1:-Install-Redux-Logger-Axios) for more detail information about how to implement it.

## Dependency

- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): JavaScript with syntax for types.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/): A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
- [Redux-Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/): An intuitive Redux side effect manager.
- [Mui/Material](https://mui.com/): The React ui library

## Quick start
- Make sure your NodeJS and npm versions are up to date for `React 17`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Check environment parameters in .env* files
- Run the independent frontend `npm run start:demo`
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start:prod/demo`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build:prod/demo`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
